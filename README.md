This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in PHP when using unset() within a foreach loop iterating over an array.  Modifying the array's structure during iteration can cause the loop to skip elements, resulting in unexpected output. The bug.php file illustrates the problem, while bugSolution.php offers a corrected approach. The problem arises from how PHP's internal pointer works within foreach and how unset() changes the array's internal structure.
